# Project 1: Sensor fusion model based on a Bayesian Network

For this project, our team set out to create a way to fuse the NAO robot's sonar and landmark detection capabilities to determine its orientation in a 20 x 20 inch square, with an estimated distance away from the wall it would predominanty face. We sought to accomplish using a sensor fusion technique, based on a Bayesian Network carefully developed over the past few weeks. Currently, have an initial Bayesian Network design for handling the sensor fusion. We have additionally defined random variables that will be observed in our Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) for each node in the Bayesian Network. We are currently collecting data in order to further define and build up our CPTs, effectively probabilistically characterizing the sensor inputs we receive from the NAO's sensors and cameras.

The code for collecting the data from the robot can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/floridatechcse5694sp19/WallBayesianNetwork/master/csvwriter.py .
